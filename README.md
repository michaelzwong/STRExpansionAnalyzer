# STRExpansionAnalyzer
This project provides tools to analyze and visualize short tandem repeat expansions.

## Background Information
Short tandem repeats (STRs) are tracts of repetitive DNA. Typically, they are
short sequences of 2-6 nucleotides repeated adjacently two or more times in a head
to tail manner. STR loci are prone to mutations and high rates of polymorphism<sup>1</sup>. Expansions
of STR loci can be pathogenic and have been attributed to more than 40 Mendelian diseases<sup>2</sup>.
As well, they have been strongly linked to more complex disorders like autism spectrum syndrome<sup>3</sup>.
